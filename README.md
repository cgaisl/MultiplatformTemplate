### Modern Multiplatform Development Template

This repository is an extension of
my [Template for Modern Android Development](https://github.com/cgaisl/ModernAndroidTemplate). This template implements
the iOS version of the sample app using Kotlin Multiplatform and SwiftUI. Everything but the UI is shared between the
two apps.
